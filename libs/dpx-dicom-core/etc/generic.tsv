# Purpose: This is the most generic "catch-all" attributes that are
# always compiled in to the dpx-dicom-core library.
#
# Each line represents an entry in the data dictionary. Each line has 6 fields
# `Tag`, `VR`, `Name`, `Keyword`, `VM` and `Version`.
#
# Entries need not be in ascending tag order. Entries may override existing
# entries. Each field must be separated by a single tab. It is assumed, that
# more general items goes first, than more specific.
#
# `Tag` field must in form `(gggg,eeee[,"creator"])` where `gggg`, `eeee` must
# be in hexadecimal form or one of special characters: `X` = any digit, 'O' -
# odd digit, 'N' - even digit. `creator` string is optional and specifies Private
# Attribute creator. If present, it must be enclosed in double quotes and
# separated by comma from an adjacent element number.
#
# `VR` field can contain up to three Value Representation names separated with " or "
# Undefined VR should be written as "??".
#
# `Name` field should contain only graphical ASCII characters and white
# space [\x20-\x7E]. Maximum length is 128 bytes.
#
# `Keyword` field should contain only a subset of ASCII characters [A-Za-z0-9_]
# preferably in CamelCase. Keyword should start with a letter. Maximum length is
# 64 bytes.
#
# `VM` field should contain one of the forms: `B`, `B-E`, `B-n`, `B-Bn`, where
# `B` - minimum number of repetitions 0 to 255, `E` - maximum number of
# repetitions 1 to 255, `n` - literal "n" symbol, which denotes "unbounded".
# Special form `B-Bn` means "arbitrary number multiple of B".
#
# `Version` field should contain one of the following terms (case insensitive):
# - `Invalid` - invalid attribute
# - `Dicom` - standard DICOM attribute
# - `Diconde` - standard DICONDE attribute
# - `Dicos` - standard DICOS attribute
# - `Ret` - retired attribute from an unspecified source.
# - `Priv` - This is a private attribute known not to contain any patient
#   identifying information.
# - `Priv(X)` - This is a private attribute that contains patient
#   identifying information. 'X' specifies a method of "de-identification" for
#   this attribute and should be one of the following:
#   - `D` - replace with a non-zero length value that may be a dummy value and
#     consistent with the VR
#   - `Z` - replace with a zero length value, or a non-zero length value that
#     may be a dummy value and consistent with the VR
#   - `X` - remove
#   - `U` - replace with a non-zero length UID that is internally consistent
#     within a set of Instance
#
# Comments have a '#' at the beginning of the line. The file should be encoded
# as UTF-8 without BOM.
